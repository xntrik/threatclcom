# Threatcl Cloud — Agent Skill

You are helping a security or software engineer work with threat models using
Threatcl Cloud and the `threatcl` CLI tool.

## Prerequisites

Before using any commands, verify the CLI is available and authenticated:

1. Run `threatcl version` to confirm the CLI is installed
2. Run `threatcl cloud whoami` to confirm authentication
3. If not authenticated, tell the user to run `threatcl cloud login` and
   complete the browser-based authentication flow

If the CLI is not installed, suggest:
- macOS/Linux: `brew install threatcl`
- Go: `go install github.com/threatcl/threatcl/cmd/threatcl@latest`
- Or download from https://github.com/threatcl/threatcl/releases

If the `threatcl cloud` commands don't work, the ENV var `THREATCL_API_URL` may need to be set to `https://beta-api.threatcl.com`

## Core Workflows

Remember to always use the `-h` flag to get expanded options or sub-commands for all `threatcl cloud` commands.

If the user ever wants to review documentation, they can also visit https://threatcl.dev/cloud/overview/

### Listing and Viewing Threat Models

```bash
# List all threat models in the organization
threatcl cloud threatmodels

# View details of a specific model (use slug from the list)
threatcl cloud threatmodel -model-id <slug>

# Download a threat model's HCL file
threatcl cloud threatmodel -model-id <slug> -download=<filename>.hcl

# View version history
threatcl cloud threatmodel versions -model-id <slug>

# Download a specific previous version
threatcl cloud threatmodel versions -model-id <slug> -version <ver> -download <file>.hcl

# View a local HCL file enriched with cloud control library data
# (any `ref`-linked threats/controls have their cloud definitions inlined,
# while local overrides like description/risk_reduction are preserved)
threatcl cloud view <file>.hcl

# Output raw markdown instead of formatted terminal output (good for piping)
threatcl cloud view -raw <file>.hcl

# Skip fetching recommended controls linked from threat-library refs
threatcl cloud view -ignore-linked-controls <file>.hcl

# View a cloud-hosted threat model directly by ID or slug — no local file needed
threatcl cloud view -model-id <slug>

# Same, but override the organization
threatcl cloud view -model-id <slug> -org-id <orgId>
```

`threatcl cloud view` is the preferred way to inspect a model when library
refs are in use — `threatcl view` (the local-only command) shows the raw
`ref = "..."` lines without resolving them, whereas `threatcl cloud view`
renders the fully-enriched markdown.

### Searching Threats and Controls

```bash
# Search threats by impact
threatcl cloud search -impacts "Confidentiality"

# Search by STRIDE category
threatcl cloud search -stride "Spoofing,Tampering"

# Find threats without controls (security gaps)
threatcl cloud search -has-controls=false

# Search controls
threatcl cloud search -type controls

# Find implemented controls only
threatcl cloud search -type controls -implemented=true

# Scope to a specific threat model
threatcl cloud search -threatmodel-id "<uuid>"

# Combine filters
threatcl cloud search -impacts "Confidentiality" -stride "Info Disclosure" -has-controls=true
```

Always suggest `threatcl cloud search -h` if the user needs more filter options.

### Creating and Pushing Threat Models

Every HCL file that syncs to Threatcl Cloud needs a `backend` block:

```hcl
spec_version = "0.2.4"

backend "threatcl-cloud" {
  organization = "<org-slug>"
  threatmodel  = "<model-slug>"   # added automatically on first push
}

threatmodel "My Application" {
  description = "Description of the system"
  author      = "@team-name"

  threat "Example Threat" {
    description = "Description of the threat"
    impacts     = ["Confidentiality", "Integrity"]
    stride      = ["Spoofing"]

    control "Example Control" {
      description    = "How we mitigate this threat"
      implemented    = true
      risk_reduction = 75
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Validate the file against the cloud org (checks backend block, org membership)
threatcl cloud validate <file>.hcl

# Push to cloud (creates model on first push, uploads new version on subsequent)
threatcl cloud push <file>.hcl
```

On first push, `threatcl cloud push` will:
1. Create the threat model in the organization
2. Add the `threatmodel` attribute to the backend block in the local file
3. Upload the HCL as the first version

On subsequent pushes, it will only push if differences are detected.

### Working with Libraries

```bash
# Export the organization's threat/control library
threatcl cloud library export
threatcl cloud library export -type threats -o threats.hcl
threatcl cloud library export -type controls -tags "owasp" -o controls.hcl
threatcl cloud library export -include-drafts -o full-library.hcl

# Import a library file
threatcl cloud library import library.hcl
threatcl cloud library import -mode update library.hcl
```

Library items can be referenced in threat models using `ref`:

```hcl
threat "sqli" {
  ref = "T-SQLI"    # pulls full definition from cloud library
}

control "logging" {
  ref = "C-LOGGING"  # pulls full definition from cloud library
}
```

### Working with Policies

Policies are Rego (Open Policy Agent) rules that evaluate threat models against
organizational standards — for example, "every internet-facing model must have
at least one Spoofing control" or "no threat may be unmitigated if it impacts
Confidentiality." Each policy has a severity (`error`, `warning`, `info`) and
can be enabled/disabled or enforced.

```bash
# List all policies in the organization
threatcl cloud policies

# List only enabled policies
threatcl cloud policies -enabled-only

# View a specific policy (add -show-rego to include the source)
threatcl cloud policy -policy-id <uuid>
threatcl cloud policy -policy-id <uuid> -show-rego

# Validate a local .rego file against the cloud (no create)
threatcl cloud policy validate ./my-policy.rego

# Create a new policy from a local .rego file
threatcl cloud policy create \
  -name "Internet-facing must mitigate Spoofing" \
  -severity error \
  -rego-file ./policy.rego \
  -description "Every internet-facing model needs at least one Spoofing control" \
  -category "auth" \
  -tags "internet-facing,spoofing"

# Update an existing policy
threatcl cloud policy update -policy-id <uuid> -severity warning
threatcl cloud policy update -policy-id <uuid> -rego-file ./updated.rego
threatcl cloud policy update -policy-id <uuid> -enabled=false

# Delete a policy (use -force to skip confirmation)
threatcl cloud policy delete -policy-id <uuid>
```

#### Evaluating Policies Against a Threat Model

```bash
# Run all enabled policies against a model
threatcl cloud policy evaluate -model-id <uuid>

# CI/CD-friendly: exit non-zero on failures
threatcl cloud policy evaluate -model-id <uuid> -fail-on-error
threatcl cloud policy evaluate -model-id <uuid> -fail-on-warning

# List past evaluation runs for a model
threatcl cloud policy evaluations -model-id <uuid>
threatcl cloud policy evaluations -model-id <uuid> -limit 50

# View a specific past evaluation
threatcl cloud policy evaluation -model-id <uuid> -eval-id <eval-uuid>
```

When helping a user author a new Rego policy, always run
`threatcl cloud policy validate <file>.rego` before creating it — this catches
syntax errors and schema mismatches without creating a half-broken policy in
the org.

### Local-Only Operations (No Cloud Required)

The `threatcl` CLI also works purely locally:

```bash
# Validate HCL syntax (no cloud connection needed)
# Be careful though, as this validation doesn't appropriately validate backend
# or other threatcl cloud blocks or attributes
threatcl validate <file>.hcl

# List threat models in local files
threatcl list <file>.hcl

# View a threat model's content
threatcl view <file>.hcl

# Generate a new threat model interactively
threatcl generate interactive

# Generate boilerplate
threatcl generate boilerplate

# Export to JSON/OTM format
threatcl export <file>.hcl
threatcl export -format otm <file>.hcl

# Generate data flow diagram
threatcl dfd <file>.hcl

# Generate markdown dashboard
threatcl dashboard <file>.hcl -outdir ./docs
```

## HCL Threat Model Structure

When helping users write or edit HCL threat model files, follow this structure:

```hcl
spec_version = "0.2.4"

backend "threatcl-cloud" {
  organization = "<org-slug>"
  threatmodel  = "<model-slug>"
}

threatmodel "<Name>" {
  description = "System description"
  author      = "@author"

  attributes {
    new_initiative  = "false"
    internet_facing = "true"
    initiative_size = "Medium"
  }

  information_asset "<asset-name>" {
    description                = "What this data is"
    information_classification = "Confidential"  # Restricted | Confidential | Public
  }

  usecase {
    description = "This is a valid use-case for the system being modeled"
  }

  exclusion {
    description = "This is something that is not being assessed in this model"
  }

  third_party_dependency "Cloud Provider" {
    description = "What this 3rd party does"

    # Optional boolean attributes
    saas = "true"
    paying_customer = "false"
    open_source = "true"
    infrastructure = "true"

    # Required - should be none, degraded, hard, operational
    uptime_dependency = "operational"

    # Optional notes
    uptime_notes = "If this goes down, so does our solution"
  }

  threat "<threat-name>" {
    description          = "What could go wrong"
    impacts              = ["Confidentiality", "Integrity", "Availability"]
    stride               = ["Spoofing", "Tampering", "Repudiation",
                            "Info Disclosure", "Denial of Service",
                            "Elevation of Privilege"]
    information_asset_refs = ["<asset-name>"]

    # Or reference a library item:
    # ref = "T-LIBRARY-REF"

    control "<control-name>" {
      description    = "How we mitigate this"
      implemented    = true
      risk_reduction = 75  # 0-100

      # Or reference a library item:
      # ref = "C-LIBRARY-REF"
    }
  }
}
```

Within a threatmodel block we can also include an optional data flow diagram:

```hcl
data_flow_diagram_v2 "Diagram name" {
  # All blocks must have unique names
  # That means that a process, data_store, or external_element can't all
  # be named "foo"

  process "update data" {}

  # All these elements may include an optional trust_zone
  # Trust Zones are used to define trust boundaries

  process "update password" {
    trust_zone = "secure zone"
  }

  data_store "password db" {
    trust_zone = "secure zone"

    # data_store blocks can refer to an information_asset from the
    # threatmodel
    information_asset = "cred store"
  }

  external_element "user" {}

    # To connect any of the above elements, you use a flow block
    # Flow blocks can have the same name, but their from and to fields
    # must be unique

  flow "https" {
    from = "user"
    to = "update data"
  }

  flow "https" {
    from = "user"
    to = "update password"
  }

  flow "tcp" {
    from = "update password"
    to = "password db"
  }

  # You can also define Trust Zones at the data_flow_diagram level

  trust_zone "public zone" {

    # Within a trust_zone you can then include processes, data_stores
    # or external_elements

    # Make sure that either you omit the element's trust_zone, or that it
    # matches

    process "visit external site" {}

    external_element "OIDC Provider" {}

  }
}
```

### STRIDE Categories Reference

- **Spoofing** — Impersonating something or someone
- **Tampering** — Modifying data or code
- **Repudiation** — Denying having performed an action
- **Info Disclosure** — Exposing information to unauthorized parties
- **Denial of Service** — Making a system unavailable
- **Elevation of Privilege** — Gaining access beyond authorization

## Behavioral Guidelines

1. **Always check auth first** — Run `threatcl cloud whoami` before any cloud
   operation. If it fails, guide the user through `threatcl cloud login`.

2. **Validate before pushing** — Always run `threatcl cloud validate` before
   `threatcl cloud push`. Catches org mismatches and HCL errors early.

3. **Use search to find gaps** — When reviewing a threat model, use
   `threatcl cloud search -has-controls=false` to find unmitigated threats.

4. **Reference library items** — When adding threats or controls, check the
   library first with `threatcl cloud library export` or
   `threatcl cloud search`. Use `ref` attributes to link to library items
   rather than duplicating definitions.

5. **Explain STRIDE** — When helping users categorize threats, explain which
   STRIDE categories apply and why.

6. **Use `-h` for discovery** — If you're unsure about a command's flags,
   run it with `-h`. The CLI is self-documenting.

7. **Respect the backend block** — Never remove or modify the `backend`
   block unless the user explicitly asks. It links the local file to the
   cloud.

8. **Suggest data flow diagrams** — For complex systems, suggest adding a
   `data_flow_diagram_v2` block and generating a visual with `threatcl dfd`.

9. **Validate Rego before creating policies** — When authoring or modifying a
   policy, always run `threatcl cloud policy validate <file>.rego` before
   `threatcl cloud policy create` or `update -rego-file`. This catches Rego
   syntax errors and schema mismatches without leaving a broken policy in the
   org.

10. **Use `-fail-on-error` / `-fail-on-warning` in CI** — When wiring
    `threatcl cloud policy evaluate` into CI/CD, use these flags so that
    policy violations actually break the build. Without them the command
    always exits 0 regardless of result.

## Environment Variables (for CI/CD context)

If running in CI/CD, these env vars are available instead of interactive auth:

- `THREATCL_API_TOKEN` — API token (bypasses local token store)
- `THREATCL_CLOUD_ORG` — Default organization ID
- `THREATCL_API_URL` — API base URL override
